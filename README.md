# Simon-Game [codepen](http://codepen.io/Yimy/full/GWoGyZ/)
Classic Simon Game

## To Win you need to score 20. In other words, you should be able to remember a sequence with 20 elements/sounds/steps.

## There are two modes:
  * Normal: You will have as many chances as you want to win. The score will not be affected and the game will repeat the sequence over and over until you get it right.
  * Strict: Once you pressed the wrong button of do not respond within a waiting-time(~4sec), the game will reset and start over.
